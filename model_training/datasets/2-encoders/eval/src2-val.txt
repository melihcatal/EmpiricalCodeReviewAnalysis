remove Stringformat
Im sure provide VAR_4 constructor need set
This line updated call new onearg METHOD_2 method logs errors correct subobject code
create _CODE_ delegates Parameter
Isnt basically delete remove
Some parentheses improve readability please
rename also METHOD_2 something like
Remove comment
This doesnt really matter Val _CODE_ pass false VAR_1 might better conceptually also pass false
use braces even one line blocks
combine two lines
Do want try releasing remaining resources first failure I dont know maybe terminate transaction release everything anyway noting observation
I spot unit test one Especially check one reacts edgecases null empty string non existing class etc
nit could use lambda TYPE_1 new TYPE_1 code
This called _CODE_ factory thingy I think doesnt need could made private
final field computed values constants
Keep VAR_4 end
Please make final
Package private always enough testing Use package tests
symmetry either qualify field remove others smile
Maybe remove useless super
Why need change
Does really belong I think better home would perhaps thing configures mfa VAR_1 general It would best try keep VAR_1 defn _pure_ possible interject feature actually used
maybe need specific TYPE_2 Type
Now I know sometimes got 123123123123null entries users sweat_smile
Arent decrementing VAR_2 twice First query get queued _CODE_ get called query start running _CODE_ gets called decrements query finish METHOD_1 get called decrements right
need make sure one call METHOD_2 queue maybe synchronize around start
_CODE_ nothing
I think done directly _CODE_ execution steps possibility custom undoredo strategy
thisprotocols new _CODE_ _CODE_ seems better
Why string null actual null _CODE_
maybe would better create empty TYPE_5 java VAR_3 null parentContexthasKeyREQUEST_CONTEXT_DATA_HOLDER_ATTR_NAME
dont need bracket
Im sure correct The TYPE_2 push pull mode The push mode uses _CODE_ METHOD_1 pull mode uses METHOD_7 Im confident using METHOD_1 pull mode would want Instead I suggest simply call METHOD_7 every TYPE_2 modify METHOD_7 properly handle called _CODE_
No need use _CODE_ String work
long id devraitil hériter de Record
This logging cause pretty bad spam
Formatting try around _CODE_ 1 bad component break components
specify array length based codecssize optimize
For consistence statement higher use new VAR_4
kapr thank contribution Here really invoke abstract METHOD_1 METHOD_2 one lock acquiring Further The testcase matter required Add name author list Update copyright Minor use methods blank lines method _CODE_ For future please correctly format first commit message headline 50 symbols _CODE_ link blank line header Some minor description
Return next line
Swap arguments java _CODE_ TYPE_1 VAR_1
cant line moved next read VAR_3 _CODE_
The VAR_2 never thrown
nit put variable
suggestion public void _CODE_ VAR_3
Forgot add Lets use store location hadoop url user could ever reason decide keep store location different cluster I think fsdefaultname set hdfshostname8020somepath ls hadoop location return contents somepath need validate
Whats purpose double check Is optimization avoid sync I suspect VAR_4 majority cases called VAR_3 false Therefore double check usually result VAR_4 extra round trip memory readVAR_4g VAR_3 twice maVAR_4 memory VAR_4 majority cases So may slow majority case
couldnt foo
This part slightly simpler java VAR_5 _CODE_ return _CODE_
also update interface parameter byte Or may short f want utilize 0256 range
Most nodes currently VAR_4 call intention verify strictly necessary could clear perhaps color depth buffer My reasoning cases pixels getting rewritten anyway clearing output buffers default value unnecessary I able verify standard nodes would mind checking impact would removing call perhaps clearing one two buffers _CODE_ nodes Right Im even sure default frame buffer depth buffer
final method parameters
No need methods static private void fine
For increased readability I would prefer outer written x z notation
As long _expectedExceptions_ use fail I fine Not sure whether I would change existing tests though
I think condition makes sense Can update code match surrounding formatting hard tabs use braces
dont call METHOD_3 When shutdown hook runs lead _CODE_ try remove hook java static synchronized void _CODE_ hook ifhooks null throw new _CODE_Shutdown progress _CODE_ throw new _CODE_ already running _CODE_ throw new _CODE_ previously registered hooksputhook hook
Have handle null times received tube number theyre optional
Please consider adding overridden version _CODE_ int Logger constructor accepts Duration encapsulate type conversion
Probably crash bad format string
cause conflicts best thing put VAR_2 upgraded VAR_1 VAR_2 like stated Borsty
The superVAR_1 method VAR_1 executor task queues empty workers terminated If VAR_1 writer VAR_1 executor risk racing ongoing work
Doesnt mean youll single reporter whole life worker single reporter means single task I think I thought talked new task every hour similar
Improve naming For example rename METHOD_4 _CODE_
lets try Unicode inside
You leave double avoid auto boxing
Same superdeactivate call last
Doesnt need public
I think meant brackets encapsulate entire rest method
Test methods public
b b INT_1 missed
remove VAR_10
This METHOD_2
please move list initialization used
false peculiar way express _CODE_ peculiar polite way say wrong
typo VAR_1 instead VAR_2
I think use Trie sort complexity isnt n n2 k I dont know best data structure use top head I search How many clauses reasonable 5 may matter big picture
_CODE_
look This class deprecated longer updated
You get right Per code conventions I like see brackets around else clauses
private
Return directly
Why call METHOD_7 Should unnecessary
Im sure total number tuples VAR_3 Similar places method implemented
If could get rid null check _CODE_ METHOD_1 could removed well
I dont think marking parameters final provides advantage They mutated style guide doesnt require We use final local immutable variables
These two need _CODE_
Any reason need constructor gets usernamepassword access token This reflected also constructors code
Interesting wrapping style
This catch block could probably removed
Why cast needed Cant could simply pass VAR_6 constructor
Better make static
Is conscious decision throw unchecked
Need close stream
_CODE_ enough _CODE_
ctor private
For sake consistency _CODE_ use _CODE_ _CODE_ rather setter
suggestion snull throw new _CODE_ side already abandoned VAR_3
This VAR_2 function generic name I think
Pay attention TYPE_1 Reader monitoring since readTYPE_1 throws Exception Its also Reader implementation means Closeable So must use trywithresources Also check possible TYPE_2 needs propagated
nitpick shouldnt string concatenation avoided TYPE_5 suggestion _CODE_
double VAR_3
I would flip condition since special case protocol otherwise java _CODE_ VAR_8 VAR_4
Can put without calling TYPE_2 METHOD_3 used serialize object _CODE_ youre giving String My first thought writing string string return input string If case final value test help us understand makes fail want controlcatch
Can please add _CODE_ check
I dont think foo ever exist right since opens unique inmemory db
typo method name
remove VAR_2 remove globallocal test VAR_6
This required things render _CODE_ _CODE_
We could use static versions METHOD_2 METHOD_3
use _CODE_
chyba już niepotrzebne
No need null check METHOD_3 already takes care
I wouldnt use regex matcher inside way Because label contains special char would matched properly
What use _CODE_ You use instanceof
nan
Same comment null VAR_6
This method see use Use _CODE_ check others
In JUnit4style tests assign variables defined make final want JUnit4 wont create instance class run make eligible garbage collection right run
This wasnt necessary I using constructor I added defaults battlefield activated abilities battlefield anyway It doesnt really matter I figured Id mention
Not necessary Better _CODE_ reading _CODE_ File And let message underlying error
Could static
add final
And get end check nothing collection matter
Actually dont set anything Either dont log log something like Keep property VAR_2
Transaction mandatory What kind error show case transaction present If clear enough improve Anyway would separate issue
return _CODE_ need create local var
add final
weijjia I thought decided didnt need check We never case key key store device _CODE_ INT_1
please remove
This use Arraysequals
I think METHOD_1 noarg method utilizing builder functions specify parameters timesize Though I see point METHOD_1 methods make sure way build TYPE_1 without parameters set
Why always call update update either apply change different ignore
suggestion
changing line
delegate
Even asynchronous caches commands synchronous vice versa You need check commands _CODE_ instead
METHOD_3 finally block even remove tryfinally block
This redundant TYPE_6
Why _CODE_ nit The contract equals says check obj null avoid _CODE_
Isnt better use ngrinderuserdir
I think would suitable kind padding applied messages newline
Isnt easier VAR_1 field test Are VAR_1s created different settings Having field instead local variable simplify test methods
0 можно и без константы передать
As discussed main issue check entire method Maybe moved METHOD_3 method
Dont change behavior null empty list Leave null related changes _CODE_
done
Reminder change back long discussed Slack
Is cast still necessary
This underscore also dash
I dont really see difference _CODE_ Maybe speed reading isnt snuff
minor VAR_2 empty following forloop would iterate true would returned anyway So statement redundant
unneeded cast
Again change probably shouldnt part pullrequest since seems related _CODE_ purpose debugging
Just understanding exception isnt thrown framework right If I understand correctly constructor added purpose user may throw itll deserialized Axon Server instance get back original dispatcher given command failed execution
I dont think needed protected
This METHOD_1 super class impl overridden impl You need change
I prefer following VAR_6 null return Avoids nesting therefore allows code easier understand But purely optional
Wrong indent previous line wrapped
The TYPE_1 never thrown
suggestion private static TYPE_1 getTYPE_1ArgumentAtTYPE_1 type int index
Boolean parameters notoriously buggy Itd better use enum instead boolean
нужна ли эта переменная почему бы не ограничиться константой
curious approach single line code
intellij continuously recommending simplify code way think hard understand way
remove _CODE_ _CODE_ calls METHOD_3 _CODE_ appropriate
shouldnt TYPE_2 caught method used example lead ignoring new value
I see route mockmyapp assertions mock Can 3 lines removed extended routebuilder actually fill mock endpoint The second test
Why use _CODE_ instead If want use something specific printing messager pass arguments _CODE_ For debugging would much easier _CODE_
Since unplayed played little confusing maybe change _CODE_
lets use convention name VAR_4
_CODE_ Severity _CODE_ Remove use METHOD_4 deprecated rule
tend use braces placing statement seperate line check developers guide sunjavaconventions 100 cols
Very minor lets try consistent order method parameters
Instead null use c And remove null checks VAR_4 null
This might splitting hairs probably _CODE_ VAR_5 instead type
Here making many allocations
Nit please avoid reformatting
linebreak place best choice
Change _CODE_ TYPE_2YPE_3 super TYPE_2
bulb This code tryfinally exceptionsafe closing VAR_6 instance
This seems wrong method parameter VAR_1 false assigning true thisVAR_1 Is correct _
Are expecting get Workflow jobs If I think work
The super implementation noop design
nit remove else return block anyway
final needed I think gwt compiler nothing final attribute anyways
Is behavior To specific need charset Because producing already string
parts1isEmpty
static
Check copypaste
This line needs colon make case VAR_6 I would also like note lower smooth brick check
reuse overloaded METHOD_1 method passing distribution type Optionalempty
Do want remove debug
Do ever use returned value Even put cluster registry use IGNORE_RETURN_VALUES
Shouldnt happen shut VAR_2 bound
Can VAR_3 null
We set servlet path test pass
In Drill unit tests usually use static import assert methods Please revert
Id METHOD_4 Objectsequalschannelget key null checking _CODE_ really useful function required eg streamfilter add extra method call jit decide whether inline compared obj null
Nit return VAR_1 null VAR_2 VAR_1
Message last boolean _CODE_
static import
I think private since shouldnt overridden
It took little unwinding I followed code _CODE_
Similar urn_perun_group_attribute_def_def_unixGID_namespacejava The output contain something like Disallowed crosschecks modules peformance reason dependenciesaddA_G_unixGID_namespace dependenciesaddA_R_unixGID_namespace dependenciesaddA_R_unixGroupName_namespace
try use _CODE_ _ instead
Just really styleconscious _CODE_ would good VAR_3 well Or could move _CODE_ line change constructor argument _CODE_ TYPE_2
Missing _CODE_ method
Add tooltip
This becomes unreadable many chain logic operations ternary blocks I believe proper statements would preferred readable
God kills kitty every time developer writes without braces
According javadoc method VAR_1 visits internal data container METHOD_2s size although data container bit vague sounds like need additional METHOD_2 call _CODE_ instead sticking right instance size
params final right probably missed one code
Perhaps trywithresources I need understand suppressed exceptions
use _CODE_
_CODE_ Make METHOD_1 static method rule
Dont need _CODE_ call end
Are assuming VAR_1 nonempty
Could please replace boilerplate pattern single method _CODE_ _CODE_ thoughout code
_CODE_ Severity _CODE_ Immediately return expression instead assigning temporary variable VAR_2 rule
Can switch java thisnew TYPE_1
I know already like weird dropping view creating If goal assert throws exception assert otherwise anything
I realize wasnt smart enough ideally method would return null METHOD_2 METHOD_4 return null
move check back first method change behaviour null passed VAR_2 _CODE_ thread
remove super call
Return VAR_3 instead available
cvrebert lets avoid composite names call var evts
I think needs updated well
I think check unnecessary omitted id supposed nonnull construction TYPE_2 fail otherwise
change order
Not threadsafe despite use wrapped _CODE_ registeredcontains registeredadd collectively atomic
Thats logic method If already sure VAR_1 The real problem definitely _CODE_ implementation We check presence All logic affected Please make remove method protected
Can private
The last null interpreted null Flag null Flag causing _CODE_ test suite
On _CODE_ unique _CODE_ ugly nonhuman readable string subject object id Does map previous functionality METHOD_1 I would think displayable id would closer want
We may want assert _CODE_
Maybe move inside body since wont always execute batch
You need make overload youre going change method signatures _CODE_ _CODE_ users
Remove extra parentheses
I would use _CODE_ instead
What made wrap still use simple long afterwards
Its really good expose places nothing doesnt get hidden
Id name argument VAR_3 thats really
yepp old code bit dirty
makes entry infinite ttl
If VAR_5 last time METHOD_5 called calling effect
This call _CODE_ VAR_1 Thats reason widget implement _CODE_ interface begin The METHOD_4 method visible called There need call METHOD_2 either method protected void _CODE_ data _CODE_ data null datasize 0 thisVAR_1_CODE_data thisVAR_1setVisibletrue else _CODE_
You use method reference return _CODE_
maybe simply java VAR_1 VAR_3 _CODE_
Would code cleaner TYPE_1 node VAR_1 node _CODE_ _CODE_ null
I think line also removed since ENABLE_SAVE_CODE_FOR_DEBUG_TOPN disabled tests
Merge return since computing boolean anyway java return VAR_2 null SCHEME_FILEequalsVAR_2getScheme thing last thing
Im ok either capitalization But needs consistent The overutilized 2 lines capitalized differently
Any chance could add constructor takes metadatsource VAR_3
Is reason METHOD_4 directly called TYPE_2 It called TYPE_2 places changed I suggest call consistently troughout whole file Current occurencs METHOD_3 lines 539 731 770 1758 Line 1758 additionally candidate using _CODE_ instead _CODE_
I would probably merge two lines one _CODE_ Same goes interceptor _CODE_ Though preference I guess
nit extra space
minor since one lock could use _CODE_ _CODE_
use _CODE_ VAR_1 see previous comment
could else I think
I know pt used logging implicitly converted byte int
Consider use Optional
Why assigning 0 VAR_3 assign value next line
start 5 length 4 trailing space
Rewrite obj _CODE_ _CODE_ return return obj
sure best way handle exception
hm want change _CODE_ accept full names
nan
Not sure code
Omit Java default
b b INT_1 missed
_CODE_
doesnt belong
Same consideration class _CODE_ constructor
Just consistency need keyword see getter _CODE_
I think VAR_3 passed second param according doc _CODE_ actual Object expected String message
please also assert return value
Maybe next refactoring use inheritance composition pattern extract _CODE_ _CODE_ methods eg abstract class dont implemented almost every service
principal login test already print root cause still need print
copypaste
Would make sense accept intlong VAR_3 wrappingreleasing function
This actually isnt optimization _CODE_ f calls new Floatf
You METHOD_3 calling superstop
Shouldnt Loge
Setting dates handled inside METHOD_9 method required
A Java constructor automatically call noargument super isnt needed
Is part existing code Consider 2 line logic I feel makes sense part _CODE_ function VAR_1 VAR_3 swapVAR_1 VAR_3 double x VAR_1 VAR_2 VAR_3 VAR_4 VAR_2 VAR_4 return MathmaxVAR_1 Mathminx VAR_3
Why need use conditional expression print true false isnt enough directly priny _CODE_
really possible VAR_11 null point
Ah missed last time though We also perform wrappedget inside lambda time perform get included latency
I foresee clashes Should least use type name

Can add generic parameters acceptors Like _CODE_
Please consider adding overridden version _CODE_ int Logger constructor accepts Duration encapsulate type conversion
It seems like make variable real reason We could return new TYPE_1 bottom return
Since _never_ want try get instance info dont instance code I dont think getSharedPreferencesgetStringinstance_code makes sense Instead check instance code log error skip getting instance info since know fail
return one line
name argument used
Based new method signature third arg object code fourth subobject code
Why simply call return _CODE_
VAR_10 might return null
Unclear circular dependencies objects _CODE_ methods problem past Might safer print names
Once I dont understand obtain VAR_3 boolean _CODE_ send back _CODE_getConditionalContext Same instances
Remove TYPE_3 catch statement rewrite Null check
suggestion return new _CODE_ TotalHitsRelationEQUAL_TO 0 1234 VAR_5 null
Fix VAR_2 VAR_2
loginfo logerror
Missing synchronization
see
Why creating new random instance iteration loop Also shouldnt using m_ prefix
If theyre impossible actually usually prefer _CODE_ I would leave asis never observable users
Instead remove synchronized setter make variable volatile
Can please follow coding guidelines put code curly braces
I think also need call size Can please also adjust unit test check
Dont project open _CODE_ null check Can field go view mode directly populated readonly property set I dont actually know possible currently V8
minor required anywhere
This line removed ensure METHOD_4 _CODE_
I think TYPE_10 TYPE_11 implement need remove list well
_CODE_ level

Why delegate closing executor
This doesnt look right
suggestion _CODE_ VAR_2 _CODE_ VAR_1
я вообще думал что выстрел будет делаться так gunfire те _CODE_ _CODE_ выполнять в методе класса TYPE_1
Changing public constructor breaks compatibility Please add second original constructor delegate You may mark older constructor deprecated get back one release 314
Could add type parameters constructor calls
suggestion return _CODE_ 1 _CODE_ 1 relationInfoprimaryKeyget0nameequals_id I think dont null TYPE_1 entries
Use braces even condition one line
TYPE_2 VAR_4 start 8 length 21 line 94 line 111 Closed
_CODE_ repository _CODE_ trywithresources better VAR_1 METHOD_4 fails initial error would swallowed code surely move parent 1625 already
Same question Maybe check implementation 632 see works
Its nice consistent use final modifier function declarations See use final elsewhere _CODE_
tokensum replaced _CODE_
I believe need make sure access VAR_1 thread safe
Not METHOD_5 anymore
Same
path
Remove unused parameter TYPE_4 VAR_2
Whats impact state transfer tests
Looks like Java 8 construct left
_CODE_ fix resource leak trywithresources block
make public
1 confusion suggestion return new Diamond3iIterableBuilderorigin radiusstartradius
Unnecessary braces
shall maybe utilize autoclosable input stream try TYPE_5 VAR_3 getUncompressedTYPE_5bytes
VAR_1 null
The VAR_16 list hashed twice I would suggest using building METHOD_1
I dont think need Its either empyt doesnt key
method expects VAR_1 VAR_2 parameters Be careful order
set final
This else
better init VAR_1 empty collection avoid null
exper0 please see
Im sure work concurrent environment Isnt shared channel Can instead use
Please expose generic types VAR_1 And VAR_1 storm VAR_1 map passing METHOD_5 reusing
VAR_2 required make constructor private
Same _CODE_ element null
Looks like _CODE_ true
minor Formatting VAR_2 null VAR_5 VAR_5availabilityZoneVAR_2
throw new _CODE_ maybe
This protected
I think delegate overloaded method public void instrumentfinal TYPE_1 VAR_1 final TYPE_2 output final String name throws TYPE_3 outputwriteinstrumentVAR_1 name
Since method defined interface would make sense _CODE_ class call method skip task instead task
This call missing second method
VAR_3 nonnull could simplified unless want stick _CODE_ generated form
Shouldnt line handled Optionally bit Encr class
Dont want give count capacity hint
I would extract 3 values eg enum 3 levels severity Warning Error Ignore Or enum least create String constants preference page keep returning strings It would less fault sensitive working strings compare _CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_
Why removing _CODE_ says If subclassess override method _CODE_ _CODE_ superinit point insider custom implementation Removing existing explicit invocation method parent class could cause uncaught errors sure Please add back solve new issue could cause
You could simplify use
I dont understand change It seems _CODE_ TYPE_3 change method signature required
nit revert
Im wondering test wouldnt easier simply single Servlet test If _CODE_ would also output value _CODE_ attribute would single servlet The servlet could output something like Query number42 Executed true Then need adjust asserts check Query number42 instead number42
Maybe version readable wanted ask noticed Here could update java final _CODE_ VAR_1 METHOD_2 METHOD_2 declared java private _CODE_ METHOD_2
This condition covered tests anyway I dont sure need condition
Instead exporting I would simply replace future usages _CODE_
Add object VAR_2 please
Was part METHOD_2 null
Comment L330 valid anymore
useless cast Same
Would _CODE_ work Same tests
lol right
It doesnt really make sense method accept TYPE_2 If call going use first VAR_1 every called method Also everything else TYPE_1 uses initialized elsewhere I would probably accept TYPE_2 within _CODE_ constructor instead See also
Should remove boolean
Is change necessary It new TYPE_3 logger
Revert
This code section extremely performance sensitive especially regarding memory consumption We need keep results double VAR_1
This correct I checked VAR_1 constructor javadoc exception thrown
Theres bit difference selecting String vs TYPE_1 whether context class loader considered Should context class loader override classgetTYPE_1Loader Im honestly sure Ive used context class loader much
Primitive int _CODE_ Integer I suppose
_CODE_ called instead _CODE_
Im sure want asserts code They enabled default _CODE_ I think VAR_3 TYPE_3 type code handle incorrect types What think
Are expecting destroy called concurrently method If value key visible different threads may value _CODE_ may change check
maybe _CODE_ _CODE_
Would great know VAR_4
import static _CODE_

Can move logic METHOD_5
Getting checkstyle warnings parameters final
Query failed Also Im pretty sure already VAR_3 failures somewhere Or dont theres good reason
These 2 called
Shouldnt kind messages placed inside _CODE_
Same loop optimization
Optional idea If user adds wildcard domain nettyio could normalized nettyio stored VAR_2 That would make cheaper line check present string concatenation would needed You could check substring I sure fast want go
Why returning TYPE_1 instead void I havent seen used anywhere
I refactoring nice Could make method protected
Looks like test VAR_4 instances inmemory datasets great speed Will places test VAR_4 instances touch disk
I think remove event cannot null youve instantiate Or dit mean check something else
_CODE_
interceptor chain needed
The _CODE_ operation kill cluster production needs go trough keys Maybe better way check health
I dont think need assert Spring never call null result
Missing generics
For better readability Since lateral check independent others split separate statement
bit weird calling _CODE_ method actually right thing
I realized network call _CODE_ So every event detail page network request twice
4 spaces
suggestion thisauthentication new _CODE_ _CODE_ null
add _CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_
Leftover METHOD_5
Dont need class qualifier
Any reason _CODE_
passed VAR_1 argument ignored You may want remove parameter used introduce one method without VAR_1 argument pass VAR_1 object received constructor
declare initialise empty string immediately gets overwritten system property
Thats way around tests fail
revert code isnt used _CODE_
VAR_1 parameter never used Class used 8 method declaration I suppose add parameter future easier clean
Should remove completely
null check _CODE_ remove
This constructor called Guice injector Make package private removing public modifier
Shouldnt line 134 Replacing _CODE_ check instead obj null check Like User object I know return false null anyway also return false compare TYPE_2 RichTYPE_2 wanted comparable In User object continue params comparison compare User Candidate _CODE_ I believe implementation least equivalent TYPE_2 User objects
VAR_3 param seems unused

This unnecessary VAR_2 added VAR_1 created
You need undo
Comparable allow null objects comparison
suggestion private static TYPE_1 _CODE_ url throws TYPE_2
implement _CODE_ methods avoid casts unboxing
Worth adding comment need call METHOD_3
Seems simplified call _CODE_ invoke _CODE_
directly return _CODE_ instanceof TYPE_2
Variable VAR_3 always contains null see line 24 therefore METHOD_2 never match
inverno I dont like style I would use continue
Main consistency code existing codebase Split single line function 3 lines signature return statement closing brace
_CODE_ use parameterized logging java _CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_ Install state transitioning 0 1 new Object
Could probably private instead protected would preferred
No need call METHOD_3 anymore
I dont think need full package anymore since arent importing Restlet TYPE_4 anymore
Perhaps skip check Since package private class
please add _CODE_
Remove redundant assertions
No reason extract variable The compilator good optimization source code still maybe simplified
Code style Private constructor static factory method
Remove METHOD_5 test class
wouldnt clearer iterate values foreach syntax something like Long value hashedEnumValues2Countvalues VAR_1 value
nit java thisVAR_2 _CODE_ VAR_2 null
use final
Why need enable disable In theory call disable work provided direct GL11 calls anywhere
As discussed use member variable parameter
minor remove directly initialize line 41
Is METHOD_1 better name length All others except _CODE_ TYPE_1 suffix name
In case member variables seem set values immediately delete lines 440441
This probably removed
pointless
int VAR_4 even return int
This null check still necessary since want pass null METHOD_5
remove explicit initialization
method could static guess relevant method necessary see one usage
The _CODE_ used VAR_12 VAR_11 names suggested lower case original code suggestion VAR_10 VAR_11 VAR_11getName VAR_12 name name_CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_ VAR_5
dilekamadushan rewrite ifelse block simply java _CODE_ _CODE_
names required match getter name
Putting _CODE_ class seems kinda gross This class either METHOD_2 METHOD_2 base decisions around whether theres character present I assume always decoding wont work since would interpret unencoded space So class probably shouldnt METHOD_2 caller responsible
Please remove line It needed
call _CODE_ call _CODE_
add _CODE_
Same issue variable names
put _CODE_ local memory limit errors thrown first
Could removed
The Arraysstream applied well
Optional replace System _CODE_ statements
Group scans wildly complicate much One odd things serialized _CODE_ As part logical plan This means class must Jacksonserializable Here plugin takes VAR_2 serializable If find need plugin hokeypokey must See wiki info
Same The new flag VAR_4 passed used _CODE_
Missing blank line
This second instance entity loader _CODE_ Please move line maybe next line line 4118 reuse instance
Typo space missing
You probably make method public consistency Same _CODE_
see
could add back old constructor dont remove public methods without deprecating first
check VAR_3 null
You skip part instanceof String
nit combine assignment thisVAR_1 _CODE_ VAR_1 null
We remove unused local variables nodes VAR_2
Lets use _CODE_ variable
_CODE_
Did intend make public
I would enable default Then also need change many tests
VAR_2 seems redundant cant always pass VAR_3 want build display name
The path unique repository Im sure relevant Just thought mentioning case
Why keeping VAR_2 null Wont null without
This test condition leads _CODE_ bad resolving VAR_5 symbol I would prefer replace VAR_4 something like _CODE_ wink
Should include timestamp time travel
please pass original exception retain stacktrace message
add VAR_2 return true
move check Abstract Delegate already access VAR_3 variable
But check explicitly zero This opaque seems like youre trying optimize away division
Do think naming _CODE_ could enough
Since forcing orientation might good idea use _CODE_ instead override METHOD_1 method print log throw exception someone tries mess
private
I dont think line adding value Cant return VAR_4 arent changing names mappings parameters
I find easier read java _CODE_ VAR_5 thisVAR_5 VAR_6 VAR_5 filteredCopyVAR_5 VAR_8 VAR_8isOrderSensitive return new _CODE_ VAR_5 VAR_11
whats extra
This already done initiator field
Missing _CODE_
breaks backwards compatability someone extends non final class
_CODE_ instead _CODE_getName Applies bellow
You dont need _CODE_ null condition
Why _CODE_ skipping lineage check I thought could still make one segment per interval running nonincrementalpublishing mode
already synchronized line 261 still need
If common use case one _CODE_ pass consider providing varargs version method make cleaner easier consume
This probably VAR_3 null VAR_3 VAR_2 something
VAR_1 METHOD_2 necessarily TYPE_1 already know going good kind You drop
Redundant check We allow passing empty list
Cell able store nonstring values Theres couple ways full data type support could implemented 1 Define _CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_ classes ability convert classes user wants change type cell 2 Make value Object 3 Make Cell fields _CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_ one valid one time determined whatever stored _CODE_
What n variable

Please remove Systemout calls
Why switching order short circuit
maybe could make shortcut FeatureSelectionallwithoutENGINE_ONLYbuild

METHOD_2 left
You probably want swap VAR_2 METHOD_2 VAR_1 METHOD_3
_CODE_ use Java 8 lambda function simplify code
VAR_1 0
At least one white line two methods please

Why change _CODE_ methods

would great mention _CODE_ message otherwise everybody hard time trying figure array
Remove TYPE_1 signature
done approach
We make inline suggestion return VAR_2
We shouldnt need check clear fields _CODE_ Closeable guarantees METHOD_1 idempotent If stream already METHOD_1d invoking method effect
Not sure super VAR_1 wildcard eg call lambda java SqlArrayVAR_1ypeMyVAR_1ypeof mytype value cant call MyVAR_1ype methods lower bound Object
Suseika please inline VAR_4
means VAR_7 greater VAR_8 Its counterintuitive Its better way VAR_7 randomnextIntVAR_8 VAR_9 1 VAR_9 besides I would recommend move method _CODE_ make main flow test scenario easier read
droneboost reason size VAR_1 restricted 1 If one results still grab first one youre
A defensive copy needed
_CODE_ hold onto VAR_2 batch get VAR_1 If please pass VAR_1 constructor class rather passing irrelevant VAR_2 batch
hmm IMAGE_JP2000 boxc3 name VAR_2 Might better update JP2Viewerjs request VAR_2s jp2 I think thats current VAR_2 name Its kind funny METHOD_1 default VAR_2 behavior actual controller methods require VAR_2 name path
Why false
_CODE_ redundant
Please keep info level
agentgonzo I dont think need keep synchronized anymore
please dont remove explicit initialization
merge one line
TYPE_1 renamed _CODE_
suggestion _CODE_ broadcast capability removed Jenkins More information
Not sure naming parameters underscore according Java standard Please consider renaming classes
The TYPE_1 never thrown
I think want reverse order
use stripemock
Same issue variable names
Same
nan
sorry making private break anything Closed
Its matter style I would reverse conditions nest 3 statements
Lets make _protected_ allow users override want
expectNextCount0 omitted simplified _CODE_
precondition checks null assert tests please
I believe avoid declaring handle directly invoke execute shared handle
lazy eventually always called build called
I know copy paste could make parameter types consistent either final none final
could one line ie return criterialist 0
minor curious passed _CODE_ whoever creating object instead creating new object every VAR_1
I think _CODE_ METHOD_1 public main feature class I miss something
Those 3 implicit super calls could removed
_CODE_ return boolean instead Boolean since _CODE_ states active required
Maybe METHOD_1 consistency
Call function single Type input instead
I hate
If keep original methods signature delegate new signature default true get bonuses If others overridden methodand added Override code still compile You wont change every call site new methods signature youll cleaner _CODE_
_CODE_ use makes code easy read I meant missing edit following ifs
Same
Why use name key TYPE_1
Should condition METHOD_1
Lets make boolean private variable please
ivandalbosco No need change order dont rely visitor finding try
suggestion _CODE_ VAR_1 VAR_1getEmail
Every member class wrapped blank lines even last method end class
I confused supposed
Remove finals
The VAR_2 part covered VAR_4 VAR_2
Youre passing message even though marker Think might throw weird _CODE_
Id make return depositctxinventoryselectnamenamepeekid VAR_1
add _CODE_ VAR_2 color name check order matter
METHOD_2
suggestion final boolean VAR_1 false
Remove please line
Message probably sent actually unloading chunks
minor return _CODE_
Please use trywithresources statement instead handling manually
check first _CODE_ instanceof VAR_4
This stuff would benefitfrom Builder maybe defaults What think p
static import METHOD_5
Fix indention
return true else return false Are kidding
You use _CODE_ java return new _CODE_FactoryjsonCodecFileBasedSystemAccessControlRulesclassfromJsonjson
代码不要揉成一团
Use _CODE_
set reference VAR_8 null consistent VAR_8 null
static
Please use Systemout Close VAR_2 line 49 67 Use spaces instead tabs _CODE_ _CODE_ Indentation looks weird _CODE_
fields order _CODE_ equals ie VAR_4 first
throws
I bit confused function exist change right add function
sure iirc use static import METHOD_3 classes
least need trim user provided string trying figure inside
_CODE_ _CODE_
minor put conditions together
Can replace VAR_4 something else
Quick style question also applies feel making exceptional case VAR_2 null Im guessing bit handle clause eg VAR_2 null return _CODE_ handle special case return listSecurityGroupsInLocationVAR_2
would better initialize _CODE_ VAR_2 instead calling METHOD_1 Presumably initializing would result potentially less array resizing
I think I goofed needs _CODE_
No need either
Out interest _CODE_
change
This removes recipients readds fixing symptom cause Do know causes underlying problem Also logic _CODE_ class
Need guarantee calling clientshutdown
No need return
Keep param order ones stack
Why _CODE_ _CODE_ _CODE_ unknown entities
Please add oneliner
According Javadoc false file exist directory cannot determined file directory This means file exist begin might declare aregular file signal incorrect callback
This needed unit tests please keep private
reason accessors enclosing class read members directly also needed might best move class file
else start 10 length 6 dont need else block
redundant parentheses
Should _CODE_
Is really something want people able override
DISCONNECT_ACTIONequalsgetIntentgetAction
Why set postgres ctor
Can refactor else one condition java VAR_1 VAR_1 METHOD_3 0 VAR_1 METHOD_2
I think address _CODE_
Are using KEY_ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATOR_RESPONSE VAR_15
_CODE_ source looks backward TYPE_1 source right
Please first log error inform user
final modifiers redundant See following methods
Same remarks equals I doubt interest last associated symbols taken account _CODE_ symbol part
Should add constructor VAR_6 accepts VAR_4 instead ignoring
Have considered likely case Is likely VAR_1 always relevant likely block given position relevant If latter likely youd gain smidgen performance inverting two expressions
The conditional thing seems wrong This probably enabledindex null index _CODE_
Being nitpicky This may erase previous _CODE_ runtime exception
primitive boolean cannot compared null
Could explain logic
METHOD_1 是否可以改成 static method
Does make sense declare throws VAR_2
Same
This packageprivate ie access modifier
Maybe also could public rest could private
Keep static imported
Should done opening db session fail fast
The else conditions dropped return That decrease cognitive complexity
still need change
Debug detected first otherwise well always take _CODE_ branch
I wonder would better rename _CODE_ And yeah remove _CODE_ altogether Breaking change agreed choice I find explicit casting style annoying removed method _CODE_
Please use method Announcer _CODE_ well
return VAR_1 instanceof TYPE_3 _CODE_
return directly
No need assign variable
private
final
_CODE_
int cast needed
Accidental box
I suggest naming second parameter attributes generic Also use list _CODE_ objects string values
using constructor doesnt use rule chain call probably missing
dont want early return remove data map want data removed even VAR_2 case VAR_3 started tracing component set VAR_2 status
I dont think need pass _CODE_ around You use new TYPE_3
nits static import
final needed
Do actually heavy lifting needs happen background If still controllerinit _CODE_ definitely executed _CODE_ thread
nan
You could make protected want
Arent superclass
comment class
You shouldnt _need_ check null since merge function called existing value always nonnull
suggestion private String _CODE_ name String VAR_1 String VAR_2 String VAR_3 String VAR_4 Nullable String VAR_4Display String VAR_6
Giving second thought might consider clearing maps better decision would nullify I assume wont remove final flag I suggest leave since closing Drillbit anyway
unecessary parentheses
I dont think type parameter necessary
Added VAR_3 response parameters longer necessary Same controllers
Consider use _CODE_
simplified return VAR_1 null
Rikkola throws TYPE_1 really necessary
If rework METHOD_4 simple iterative method dont need copy
Do need VAR_4 variable Shouldnt assign result METHOD_4 directly VAR_3
Please VAR_2emove unused b VAR_2
I guess list could empty well causing indexoutofbounds line 110 adding _CODE_ would make safer
Rename VAR_5
VAR_2 VAR_3 new VAR_2
_CODE_
_CODE_ Shouldnt done _CODE_ startting VAR_5 polling
ivange94 turn positive checkguard clause java _CODE_ return false removes one level nesting makes easier read since reader sees immediately VAR_3 empty return
Just small note add method _CODE_ returns false element already exists set contains check actually superfluous The code could changed itemsaddname _CODE_ existing registered name type name
Does work fewer changes Maybe concatenate java return new _CODE_ VAR_8 VAR_9 _CODE_
parameter sequence swapped VAR_1 min correct
Could please remove checks VAR_3 null The lack particular cruft one favourite parts services
Ill kick review Its better protected since templates report whether support _CODE_
Missing
could _CODE_ 1 metricValueStringcharAt0 also eliminate condition checking _CODE_
shouldnt need cast double
I guess never reached right
replacing lines 221 222 method _CODE_
After comment addressed METHOD_1 unnecessary well
How use renderrenderer smooth VAR_7 instead It send additional data smooth false
Can limit scope
METHOD_1
add check VAR_6 null
java return optiongetOptionTYPE_INFERENCE
Looks like leftover printlns addition assertions
No need passwordhash _CODE_
Hmm call ctor null VAR_4 besides using reflection If dont specify gets new Flag0 set null last param get null flag
You supposed remove VAR_2 arg
Since removed throw new TYPE_2 method throw exception anymore suggestion private TYPE_1 getTYPE_1
Not sure need password dont use
nan
Remove private modifier properly test
Perhaps trywithresources Needs care METHOD_6
Please always use braces even oneliners Could please change across pull
supernit midly shorter say queueofferspan
nit _CODE_ good enough Assignment VAR_6 necessary
How work I dont see specific METHOD_3 method _CODE_ Im supposing goes METHOD_3E entities superclass But since youre passing entities looks like would noop
Spaces length 0
The caller also computes VAR_5
return VAR_1
Combine return _CODE_ _CODE_ But change first place way
call add method VAR_1 instead columnsaddfield
Why _CODE_
alternative syntax 0 METHOD_2
Shouldnt VAR_3 null consistency
thos changes
Should return false indicate client connected anymore
You may able avoid compiler warnings raw types phrasing return type instanceof TYPE_2 TYPE_2 _CODE_ You use straightwildcard form generic type instanceof casts without issue
Why need change class I find reason
Why add empty list check null check _CODE_ I think necessary empty list nothing later statement
Annotations go line method declaration
Should better make method package protected allow jackson access
surround parenthesis two expressions right left make clear
I think return _CODE_ directly need create wrap VAR_4
VAR_1 null youll get _CODE_ VAR_1addrgetReachableOrOne
Any reason move declaration variable To enforce eitheror nature VAR_1 vs Either way use _CODE_ rather _CODE_
VAR_2 variable redundant
The name instance represented via key key hash represented via field This Redis keyword semantic need follow
Are sure protected static ok To doesnt make sense cant override static methods
nit youre looking final Id move field
I think return TYPE_2
Der Fall bietet keinen Mehrwert zu category oder Test entfernen oder alternativ dann gibt es kein Duplizieren _CODE_ index Category name 0 _CODE_ category
You skip declaration query value Since locked flag simple boolean returned TYPE_1 object call gets optimized basically youre without needing write There cases youll want explicitly cache stuff locally since dealing unboxing simple accessor little data store case
Shouldnt return Fluxerrore
declaring data try block
einfacher _CODE_ VAR_1
Is reason targeted sequencing set id isnt Seems like something exception thrown
Can add name VAR_2 somewhere well
We dont use method calls previous code bad generally clean modifying code
No need call METHOD_2
somewhat redundant following log statement
Should check done earlier Say start Otherwise admin wont know problem random time Drillbit starts Also since config problem shouldnt log error level admin track problem Telling query user fine user position fix problem
_CODE_ VAR_1 I dont see reason override _CODE_ going use VAR_1 feature At least assertion commit message Change aggregator use _CODE_ default unless _CODE_
minor variables use long TYPE_1 I think long good everywhere since cannot null
_CODE_ return status workflow actions
This one shouldnt public
The VAR_2 never thrown
Not sure matters shouldnt VAR_3 METHOD_3ped first doesnt move entries queue METHOD_3ped Also shouldnt VAR_4 last one METHOD_3
This catch statement isnt needed
Maybe _CODE_ 0 checked calling METHOD_2 Method METHOD_2 modifies field via reflection optionally recursively calls could costly
I dont think good idea make public What
I dont consider METHOD_1 default env strong restriction
please inline variable
I would prefer move logic TYPE_1
localequalsconfiggetmapredjobtracker
Which exception observed Please dont catch exceptions dont actually know
VAR_6 primitive null check redundant
Can make method private
VAR_3 VAR_4 already evaluated _CODE_ Send two boolean parameters function instead evaluating agan
_CODE_ _CODE_
Is possible run METHOD_2 _CODE_ without threadsleep Is better
If problem image control initially sync calling _CODE_ fix issue So need
Given VAR_2 Nullable implies name nonnull checknotnull anywhere effectively name still given null Maybe add check annotation
The method _CODE_ already returning TYPE_1 extracting Date value rewrapping new TYPE_1 seems redundant
You could skip _CODE_ false
If VAR_1 defined TYPE_1 assertion cast needed
This doesnt need public called within file
Negate condition otherwise failing value correct
I dont think called concurrently called _CODE_ I dont mind leave
shouldnt VAR_1 n
We VAR_3 VAR_1 empty
Just remove whole method used
il manque un test pour la promotion de lévenement de propagation _CODE_ 0 VAR_2 EventTypeFULL_PROPAGATIONstrengthened_mask
Is really hard 50x convert long int I mean lets change signature method 51 dont backport
How simplifying method back _CODE_ keeping evaluation within METHOD_5
